  <p>Hi. I'm Jonathan. I am a frontend engineer from Hamburg, where I work at Mesaic.</p>
  <p>I am enthusiastic about UX Design and product development.<br>This is how I work: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design: Sketching on paper / Prototyping with code</li>
      <li>Implementation: Javascript / React / React Native / Node.js </li>
      <li>Tools: Vim / Sketch / Command line</li>
    </ul>
		<p>I've studied jazz guitar for a year and have been working as a freelance guitarist since I'm 20. Practicing scales 8 hours a day turned out not to be my favorite activity, so I pivoted and got a BA in Philosophy, after that another one in Computer Science (both at Universit√§t Hamburg). I've been working in tech since then, still playing gigs now and then.</p>
    <p>Other facts:<br/>
			I like to read, mainly science fiction and UX books right now.<br/>
      I am nerdy/passionate about cooking, wine, craft beer and coffee.<br />
      I'm a proud dad and husband. :)<br />
      I love music, though I mainly listen to white noise at work. :D
