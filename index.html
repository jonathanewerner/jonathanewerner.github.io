      Hi. I'm Jonathan.<br/>
      I am a frontend engineer from Hamburg, where I work at <a href="https://mesaic.co">Mesaic</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am enthusiastic about
        <span class="tt">product development<span class="ttc">My motivation is rooted in the desire to create great products that people love to use.</span></span>
        and UX design.
      <br>This is how I work: </p>
  <p>‚Äî Design: Sketching on paper / Prototyping with code<br />
  ‚Äî Implementation: Javascript / React / React Native / Node.js<br/>
  ‚Äî Tools: Vim / Sketch / Command line
  </p>
		<p>I've studied jazz guitar for a year and have been working as a freelance guitarist since I'm 20. Practicing scales 8 hours a day turned out not to be my favorite activity, so I pivoted and got a BA in Philosophy, after that another one in Computer Science (both at Universit√§t Hamburg). I've been working in tech since then, still playing gigs now and then.</p>
    <p>Other facts:<br/>
    I like to read, mainly science fiction and <span class="tt">UX books<span class="ttc">Last one I read was <i>Sketching User Experiences</i> by Bill Buxton. Recommendation! (I bought loads of Sakura Pigma Micron and Tombow Dual Brush pens after üòú).</span></span> right now.<br/>
      I am nerdy/passionate about cooking, wine and <span class="tt">coffee<span class="ttc">I get a lot of satisfaction out of my new pour over equiment ü§ìüòç: <br />Hario V60 dripper, V60 buono drip kettle, Rommelsbacher EKM300 coffee mill, beans from Playground Coffee. Yirgacheffe's the favorite so far‚Äîif you got recommendations, hit me up. :)</span></span>.<br />
      I'm a proud dad and husband. :)<br />
      I love music, though I mainly listen to white noise at work. :D
